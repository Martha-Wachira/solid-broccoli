# Sales and Customer Insights Dashboard (Beginner Project)

This project demonstrates how to analyze fictional retail sales data using SQL (SQLite), Python, and Excel. It includes extracting data from a database, cleaning and transforming it in Python, and creating a simple Excel dashboard.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQLite
- Excel

## Key Features
- Join and query customer, orders, and product data using SQL.
- Analyze total sales by region.
- Export data to Excel for further analysis.
- Visualize insights using simple plots.

## Files Included
- `sales_data.db` â€“ SQLite database with sample tables.
- `Sales_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb` â€“ Beginner-friendly Python analysis notebook.
- `Sales_Data_Analysis.xlsx` â€“ Cleaned data export (you can build pivot tables here).
- `sales_by_region.png` â€“ Sample chart output from the notebook.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Ensure `sales_data.db` is in the same folder.
3. Run each cell to load, analyze, and visualize the data.
4. Open the Excel file to explore the data further.

This is one of my first projects in data analytics and a step forward in my learning journey.
